Look, I just flipped the switch
I don't know nobody else that's doin' this
Bodies start to drop, ayy, hit the floor
Now they wanna know me since I hit the top, 
This a Rollie, not a stopwatch
shit don't ever stop
This the flow that got the block hot
 shit got super hot
Give me my respect, give me my respect
I just took it left like I'm ambidex
Bitch, I move through London with the 
eurostep
Got a sneaker deal and I ain't break 
Catch me 'cause I'm goin' outta there,
I'm gone
How I go from 6 to 23 like I'm LeBron?
Servin' up a pack, servin' up a pack
Niggas pullin' gimmicks 'cause 
they scared to rap
Funny how they shook, ayy, got these 
niggas shook
Pullin' back the curtain by myself, 
take a look
