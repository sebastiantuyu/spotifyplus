Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my we*d smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gone let them hits fly,we gone let it go
If it ain't XO then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talking 'bout a face numbing off bag a-blow
I'm like goddamn b**ch, I am not TeenChoice
Goddamn b**ch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a n*gga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these R&B n*ggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go low mane 
You know me (know me), you know man 
you know me (know me)
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
